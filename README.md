This repository contains material from a lecture given at the *Unite!Energy Conference*, Grenoble, France, in October 2024 for master's and PhD students with diverse backgrounds. The aim is to review the basics of electrolysers for electrical engineering students and the basics of power electronics for electrochemistry students.
